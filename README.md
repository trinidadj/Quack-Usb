QUACK USB Executor
This is a Python script that allows you to execute terminal commands from a Python script. The script works on both Windows and non-Windows platforms, and can execute commands either in a separate terminal window or in the current terminal.

Requirements
To use this script, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your computer. You also need to have the subprocess and getpass modules installed, which should be included with Python by default.

Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:

Download the terminal_executor.py file to your computer.
Open the file in your favorite text editor.
Replace the commands list with the commands that you want to execute. Each command should be a string that contains a valid terminal command, such as cd, ls, mkdir, etc. You can add as many commands as you want to the list.
Save the file and exit the text editor.
Open a terminal window or command prompt on your computer.
Navigate to the directory where the evil_ducky.py file is located.
Run the script by typing python evil_ducky.py and pressing Enter.
The script will execute the commands and display the output in the terminal window or in a separate window, depending on the platform you are using.
